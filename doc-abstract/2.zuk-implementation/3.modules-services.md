Modules services
==================================
2017-01-29



As we've seen before, a zuk application uses two types of services:

- application services
- modules services



In this section, we discuss the **modules services**.




What's a module service?
====================

In zuk, a **module service** is basically a task opened to other modules.

For instance let's say you want to create a menu for your website.

You can create a **module service** for that. If you do so, then the other modules can basically hook into
your module service, which means they can help creating the menu (for instance each module can add any number of menu items).


A module can create a module service, but it also can subscribe to another module's service.

It means each module can provide its own services, and subscribe to other modules services.

A module can be either:

- a provider
- a subscriber
- both a provider and a subscriber
- none of them


There is quite a lot to say about this system,
and therefore the system has now its own page: it's called <-HASSS-> (hardcoded service subscription system).
