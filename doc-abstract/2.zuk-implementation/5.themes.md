Themes
====================
2017-01-30 --> work in progress




A theme is a cloth for a web application.
You can change the cloth as you wish, but the content stays the same.



Ok, but how do we implement it?


We already saw that the **template** will probably play a major role (<-themes overview->),
but that's all we've got so far.


Before we dive in, let's try to anticipate potential problems.


Data first, or design first?
================================

If you ask this question to me, I would say that data comes first, and then design comes after.
Indeed, you cannot display something if you don't have it.

There is no problem here, unless...


How do you name things?
=========================

You know how re-usability is an important concept in development in general, don't you?


So imagine two developers Pierre and Paul.
They each create their own cms system.

On the team page of his system, Pierre displays a table, and he creates an $items variable and pass it to the template.

On the team page of his system, Paul displays a table, and he creates a $rows variable and pass it to the template.


Designers of Pierre's system will have to use the $items variable.

But designers of Paul's system will have to use the $rows variable.


But everybody knows what a table is, don't they?

Wouldn't be it great if designers could have work only on one table?

Sure, the adaptation in this case is no big trouble, but imagine if this problem occurred on
every well known object, and for every application system, that would be quite a problem.



So, I have a remedy for this, this is call convention: an agreement between developers (who provide data)
and designers (who use the data) on how things should be named.

This convention is named ten (themable elements naming)
