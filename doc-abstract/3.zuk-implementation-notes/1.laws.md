About widget targeting
===========================


Layout (-> widgetGroup)* -> widget


1. Requirement: Controller can target any widget


2. Implementation: give each widget a unique name, and each widget group a unique name.


The layout basically holds a tree of widget/widget groups.
Each node of the tree has a unique name.
A leaf is necessarily a widget.
The path of the widget is used as its configuration id. 



About layout tree creation
=============================

1. Wish: the layout tree is consistent; it can be updated either from the bo, or the code, it doesn't matter


2. Implementation:

A layout has a number of widget groups bound to it.
Those bindures are hardcoded (cannot update them via bo).

The ensemble layout/widget groups is called the **layout skeleton**.

Widgets can be bound to the layout skeleton, either from the bo or from the code.



The layout has an init method.
The init method of the layout is responsible for creating the layout tree.
It calls the following two methods in the layout:

- prepareWidgetGroups
- prepareWidgets


The prepareWidgetGroups method is used to create the layout skeleton, it is hardcoded.
The prepareWidgets method is used to bind widgets to the layout skeleton.

It's hardcoded too, to allow a regular developer to bind widgets via the code.
But the prepareWidgets method has been purposely isolated to ease external update (via the bo).

Note: the intent is that the bo updates the code directly, so that the developer
feels comfortable with the code.
In other words, and in general in zuk, the bo is just considered as a helper for the developer.
