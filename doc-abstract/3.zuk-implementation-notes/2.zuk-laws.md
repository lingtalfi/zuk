Nomenclature
===============

Each node of the **layout tree** has a unique name, and so we can target any node of the tree, if necessary.

Let's learn some useful vocabulary.

Imagine that we are inside a Controller named MyController, which uses a layout named MyLayout, 
which contains a widget group named MyWidgetGroup, which itself contains a widget named MyWidget.

Then the following vocabulary is available:

- **MyController**: name of the Controller
- **MyWidgetGroup/MyWidget**: relative path (starting from the layout object) to the widget node, or widget group node
- **MyController/MyLayout/MyWidgetGroup/MyWidget**: absolute path of the widget node



Path and overriding paths
