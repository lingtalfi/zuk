Themes
====================
2017-01-30



A theme is a cloth for a web application.
You can change the cloth as you wish, but the content stays the same.



As web application creators, it's always good being able to say that the
theme of our application can be changed easily.
 
 
Imagine if you built a blog application with a unique theme.
All your customers would make blogs that look exactly the same.

BOOOORING.

We obviously don't want that.


**But how do you create a theme?**


When you display a html page, you have two components:
 
- the data that you want to display
- how you want to display the data 


The Template
=================

A template is a html canvas with placeholders.
It knows HOW to display a certain type of data, but only that type.


For instance, in the case of a blog application, at some point you will have to display
a blog post.
The blog post is composed of different elements, for instance:

- title
- content
- image


That's the data.

Then you can create a template which knows how to display 
those 3 elements, and only those 3 elements.
 
Another designer can create another template, which also displays those 3 elements only.
 
In fact, you can create as many templates as you want from those 3 elements.

Every time you change the template, you get a different visual result.

So that's the basic idea behind how you can create themes for a web application.
